        <p>Hi, my name is Emily!</p>
        <p>This guidebook has something for beginners and the hardcore players. Please refer to the tabs to find what you are looking for.</p>
        <p>Whether you're setting foot in the Valley for the first time, or you've spent the better part of the last few years delving into Skull Cavern, Ginger Island, or the secrets of the Junimos, there's something here for everyone. I hope you enjoy!</p>
        <h2>What is Stardew Valley?</h2>
        <p>Stardew Valley is an open-ended country-life RPG! You’ve inherited your grandfather’s old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won’t be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town’s most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!</p>
